# About this
This python project allows you to create messageboxes using tkinter's messagebox widget! 
# How to use it
To use this program, it will give you a range of options to decide the style of the messagebox. The options will be numbered as you can see for running the
program, so if you want to chose the first one you type in '1'. Then it gives you the option where you can type in the title and the message, and then
when you complete those, it shows up with the message box! When you (lets say) quit the message box it then gives you the option if you want to do it again
or not. If you type in 'y' then it does it again, if you type in 'n' then it quits. However, if you type any other key (or type 'y' or 'n' capitalised),
it will show not to press other keys (and says that don't type 'y' or 'n' capitalised) but, I think people will obey the rules. And if your wondering,
if you type a string instead of a number (for the style desision) it will say "Invalid number." and if you go out of range and lets say you type in 8 it
will say that the number is out of range.
